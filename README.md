Model Railway Projects using the Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32 Platforms

This repository contains early proof of concept and test code for various 
projects at oorail. The code here should be considered functional but 
experimental. This repository is here to help people interested in
learning more about the code and modules to build their own code.
